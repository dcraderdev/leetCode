// 1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph
// Easy

// There is a bi-directional graph with n vertices, where each vertex is labeled from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

// You want to determine if there is a valid path that exists from vertex source to vertex destination.

// Given edges and the integers n, source, and destination, return true if there is a valid path from source to destination, or false otherwise.

 

// Example 1:


// Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]], source = 0, destination = 2
// Output: true
// Explanation: There are two paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2:
// - 0 → 1 → 2
// - 0 → 2


var validPath = function(n, edges, source, destination) {


  let currNode = edges.pop()
  let stack = new Array()
  let visited = new Set()

  




    return false
};


console.log(validPath(3, [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]], 0, 2));
